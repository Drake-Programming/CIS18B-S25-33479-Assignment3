## CIS18B-S25-33479 Assignment 3

### Overview
This repository contains Java source code for Assignment 3 of the CIS18B (Spring 2025) course. The project demonstrates various object-oriented programming principles, including:
- **Decorator Pattern** (enhancing existing classes without modifying them directly)
- **Observer Pattern** (notifying observers of state changes)
- **Custom Exceptions** (handling invalid operations with descriptive errors)

The application simulates a basic bank system, where users can create accounts, deposit, withdraw, and observe transactions via a logger.
